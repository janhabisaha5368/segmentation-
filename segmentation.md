# segmentation-
Here segmentation process has been done based on the bathroom images that are annotated in milestone 3. based on the txt details and .npy file the present segmentation process has been executed. in order to execute the segmentation process it is important to install all required libraries in the python software environment.
One of the principal occupations in PC vision is picture division. Due of the necessity for low-level spatial data, this assignment is more difficult than other vision-related undertakings. Division and be that are the two principal classifications of picture division. Panoptic division is the name for the mix of these two essential exercises. Profound convolutional brain organizations' (CNN) late ascent to conspicuousness essentially affects the division region and has brought about various current viable models. In this review, we will take a gander at the improvement of CNN-based semantic and case division work.
Have likewise examined the preparation points of interest of a few best in class models and depicted similar compositional parts of probably the most state of the art models to offer an unmistakable information on hyper-boundary tuning of those models. Also, we looked at how well those models performed across different datasets. At long last, we have shown a couple of instances of state of the art panoptic division models.
